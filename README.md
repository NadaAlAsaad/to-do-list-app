This project is a simple command-line To-Do List application in Python that allows users to manage tasks interactively. Upon starting, it presents a menu with options to add, delete, show, mark as completed, edit tasks, or exit the application. Users can input their choice, and based on their selection, the program performs the corresponding action. For example, when adding a task, it prompts the user for the task description and updates the list. It utilizes loops and conditionals to handle user inputs, ensuring robust error checking for invalid entries. The application continues to run until the user chooses to exit, making it an effective tool for task management.
